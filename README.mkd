timeout-dialog.js
=================

Timeout-dialog.js is a JQuery plugin that displays a timeout popover after
a certain period of time. The timeout dialog should be used whenever you
want to display to the user that the logged in session is about to expire.
It creates a light box with a countdown and options to stay signed in or
sign out.
